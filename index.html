            <p>
                The Imitation Game is about a college professor, who is named Alan Turing.
                Alan taught math. He is also one of the best people in the nation at doing math.
                He comes up with an idea for a machine that could solve any problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                During World War 2, the Germans created a machine, called the Enigma Machine.
                The Enigma Machine created secret codes that helped the Germans talk to on another.
                These secret codes helped the Germans early in the war. Britten wanted to figure out how to break these messages, but these codes changed every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The British government created a group of people who was in charge of figuring out how to quickly break the codes.
                The government did not want anyone to know about the group, especially not the Germans.
                When Alan first joined the group, no one liked him, especially his boss.
                Alan did not want to work with anyone and wanted to do everything by himself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alan wanted to build a machine that would cost a lot of money.
                Nobody in the group thought that the machine would work.
                Alan then sent a letter to Winston Churchill, who was the boss of the government.
                Winston then put Alan in charge of the group, which allowed Alan to build his machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point in the movie, we see some of when Alan was a child.
                Nobody liked Alan very much and made fun of him in school.
                One boy liked Alan and became his friend.
                The boy's name was Christopher.
                Christopher and Alan liked to pass secret messages to each other in the middle of class.
                Alan discovered that he loved Christopher.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keira joins the code breaker group and befriends Alan.
                She teaches Alan that he should be friends with the other members of the group.
                He then brings apples and tries to tell a not very funny joke.
                The other people then decides to be his friend anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alan's machine was still not finished, and the government was not happy.
                The government wanted to fire Alan.
                Alan's friends said that if they fired Alan, they would have to fire them.
                The government decided to give the group a little more time to work on the machine.
                Alan's friends now believed that the machine would work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keira's parents wanted her to come home because she was not married yet.
                Alan did not want his friend to leave.
                Alan loved Keira and decided to propose to her.
                She also loved Alan and said yes.
                Keira stayed and helped Alan and his friends.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alan still did not know how to finish his machine.
                One night, while with his friends, he has a conversation with someone.
                This conversation gives Alan an idea.
                He makes some changes to his machine.
                The machine then broke a secret message in a matter of seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group now knew everything that the Germans ware saying.
                They also realized that they must not let the Germans know that their secret messages were not secret anymore.
                If the Germans were to learn this, they would remake their machine to make better secret messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group was now in charge of how to use the German messages without letting anyone know that they broke the codes.
                This was a tricky balance.
                Using too many messages would ruin the secret.
                Using too few messages would not be helpful.
                The group also created lies about how they got the secret messages.
                Everyone believed these lies, even the British military.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the machine that Alan invented, the war ended two years earlier then it was going to.
                After the war, Alan was still not allowed to tell anyone about his machine.
                He then started to make a new machine that could do more than what his code breaker could do.
                Today, we still make machines based on Alan's machines. We call them computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The government then discovered that Alan liked boys.
                At the time, a boy liking another boy was illegal.
                Since what he did during the war was still a secret, people only knew that he was a teacher.
                The government put in a newspaper that Alan was a criminal.
                The government then decided to give Alan pills that would stop him from liking other boys.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keira then visits Alan and sees that the pills made Alan sick.
                After a year of taking the medication, he decides that his life was miserable.
                To end his suffering, Alan killed himself.
            </p>
            <h2>Summery</h2>
            <p>
                A math teacher named Alan Turing created a machine that broke secret codes made by the Germans during World War 2.
                This machine was kept a secret from everyone, even after the war.
                The government gave Alan pills because he like boys.
                After one year of taking pills, Alan kills himself.
                People kept improving the machines that he built into the computers that we have today.
            </p>
            <h2>What really happened</h2>
            <img src="https://compote.slate.com/images/73b173ac-ff04-42bf-b525-f72966043c5b.jpg" title="A picture of the real Alan Turing next to Benedict Cumberbatch">
            <p>
                In the movie, Alan Turing was shown as someone who does like other people.
                He actually got along with people very well and had many friends.
                In addition, multiple people worked on Alan's machine, not just Alan.
                Keira never visited Alan while he was taking the pills that the government gave him.
                While his death was determined to by suicide, it's also possible that his death was an accident.
