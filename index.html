            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The Imitation Game is about Alan Turing, a British mathematician.
                He was not liked by his peers and was the victim of bullying during his childhood.
                That changed when World War II broke out.
                During would War II, he created a machine that ended the war several years early.
                While developing his machine, he befriended several people in a top-secret government program.
                Slowly over the course of the movie, it is revealed that Alan was gay.
                Alan struggles to keep this fact a secret, as same sex attraction was illegal at this point in British history.

            <h2>What Parents should known</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that the movie's rating of PG-13 fits very well, and children under the age of 13 should not watch the movie without some mild filtering.
                There is a sex joke in the movie about oral sex.
                In addition, Alan is accused of letting a man touch his penis.
                There is also talk of war.
                Some images of war are shown briefly, including a short video showing an amputee with a bloody stump.
                There is a scene in the movie where Alan is bullied by his classmates. The bullying consists of trapping him the wooden flooring of a classroom.
                Finally, there is frequent use of alcohol in the movie, as well as people shown smoking.

            <h2>Some lessons for children</h2>
            <img src="https://cineuropa.org/imgCache/2014/10/09/1412856472817_0620x0435_26x0x948x665_1574313246387.jpg" title="Alan get's in trouble with the government">
            <p>
                In the movie, Alan is depicted as an autistic, eccentric genius.
                He did not think that he needed the help of others in the beginning.
                He eventually makes friends with the people he was working with.
                His friends stand up to the government and convince them to give Alan more time to work on his machine.
                One talking point you can have with your children is that friends can help us out when we are facing a problem much bigger than ourselves.
                Another point is that we should befriend people of all abilities. In the movie, we saw how happy it made Alan when his friends stood up for him.

            <p>
                One of the biggest themes in the movie is that Alan was gay.
                At the time, being gay was illegal, and was punishable by either jail time or hormonal treatments.
                A conversation you could have would be to talk about how his gayness shaped Alan's social interactions with other people.
                Today, there are still a few homophobic people.
                You could talk about how we treat gays now vs. then.
                In addition, you could talk about how Alan was mistreated and how it made him feel.
                This could then lead to a conversation about how we should treat everyone with respect, no matter what their differences are.
            </p>
            <h2>Some things to know</h2>
            <p>
                The movie got several things with Alan Turing and his machine wrong.
                In the movie, he is shown to be a social outcast.
                He was really a sociable person with many friends.
                Another thing was that there already existed a machine that could decrypt messages.
                Alan's machine could decrypt those same massages much faster.
                In the movie, he writes to Winston Churchill, asking him to put Alan in charge of the project.
                This is due to the project not working in the way that he wants.
                In reality, Alan and his colleagues needed more people and more money, but they could not get these through the proper channels.
                The group then wrote to Churchill about their difficulties, to which he then ordered that they get everything that they needed immediately.
                Finally, the movie states that Alan committed suicide.
                Although this is the official cause of death, Alan Turing expert Professor Copeland argues that the facts of his death suggest an accidental death rather than suicide.

            <p>
                There are some things that the movie did get right.
                For instance, Alan was  an eccentric genius.
                One of his colleagues said this about him:
                <i>
                    "In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hey fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off.
                    His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand.
                    Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen."
                </i>
                He was also an incredibly talented runner. He tried out for the 1948 Olympics and was only 11 minutes slower than the silver medalist.
